# Context Free Grammars (CFG)

Context-free grammars are a finite set of grammar rules that describes a language.

## Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)

It's a normal form defined by Noam Chomsky where all rules of a CFG must have one of these forms:

- $A \rarr a$
- $B \rarr CD$
- $S \rarr \epsilon$

Where $A, B, C, D, S$ are non-terminals, $a$ it's a terminal and $S$ it's the initial.
